# HouseHotkey
Addon for hotkeying houses in Elder Scrolls Online

 Bind collected or favorited houses to the hotbar for quick fast travel (inside or outside option only available for collected houses).  Heavily inspired by @MelanAster's [Quickslash](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info3955-QuickSlash-AddSlashCommandstoQuickslotsWheels.html)
